String analogWatch= 'An analog watch is a classic timekeeping device that displays time through rotating hands on a dial, marking hours, minutes, and often seconds. Unlike digital watches, it embodies craftsmanship and tradition, featuring intricate mechanical movements or precise quartz mechanisms.
